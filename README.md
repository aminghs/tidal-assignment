# Below is the task that Tidal would like me to perform:

Using the Deezer REST API (https://developers.deezer.com/api) perform the following
actions and display the results using the attached designs. (You might need to create a
free account with Deezer.) Please install CORS Chrome extension to ignore the CORS error.
The assignment will cover the following:

1. Create an autocomplete search for artist that populates a option list while you
type -

1. When clicking on an item in the result set you should present and list the
ALBUMS for that artist as displayed in the attached design

1. When clicking an ALBUM you should expand a field like the one in the design
under the headline :Planet Earth and list information from the album
Utilize the Deezer API to perform the tasks above using React/Redux (and any other
libraries you see fit).



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
